<h2>My story</h2>

<p>Speeding around a race circuit on a motorcycle is a huge adrenaline rush. Just you and the bike, working in harmony, trying to achieve ever-faster lap times in a personal pursuit for performance. It’s the ultimate escape and one of the last true bastions of freedom in our safety-conscious world.</p>
<p>I first caught the track day 'bug' in 2015 after an evening ride around Cadwell Park racing circuit, Lincolnshire. From that first lap, experiencing the speeds my bike was capable of, I was hooked on track riding.</p>
<p>But what happens when the fun stops and your luck runs out? Last summer I experienced this the hard way - running out of talent midway through Chris Curve corner at Cadwell Park. I was left skidding across the grass banking on my head at roughly 100mph with my bike in hot pursuit – all the while summersaulting into more and more pieces.</p>

<p>When everything came to a stop, I stood at the side of the track with my helmet ever so slightly twisted on my head. I was readying myself for the inevitable sight of my pride and joy in a crumpled heap. It was at this point that track days stopped being fun.</p>
<p>However, once I had calmed down and assessed the damage, my next thought was how I could get out on the bike again and when I could get my next track fix. Why? It is a dangerous addiction.</p>
<p>What followed was a two-day intensive repair effort. Parts needed to be replaced and the whole bike needed to be checked to make sure it was safe to ride once more. However, at no point did I ever consider this setback the end of my time on track.</p>
<p>My story is a similar one to many other riders around the United Kingdom, who risk their pride and joy on British race circuits for the brief thrill of speed. Join me as I explore the phenomenon of track days and find out why others do it and how you can get involved too.</p>

<header><h1>What is a track day and how does it differ from racing?</h1></header>
</section>
<section class="content">
<h2>What's the difference?</h2>
<p>Track days, for both cars and motorcycles, differ quite significantly from motorsport. A track day is in no way a race and simply offers a chance for riders to enjoy time on a track and explore the potential of their machine.</p>
<p>People may be racing themselves – pushing for quicker lap times and better lines through corners, but it should not be considered a competitive environment. As soon as it does, accidents start to occur.</p>
<p>A motorcycle race on a closed circuit differs because riders compete against one another to cross the line first over a set number of laps. These races occur at most tracks between riders of varied skill level.</p>
<div class="BSB"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJ969zo9O04" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>The pinnacle of British racing is the <a href="http://www.britishsuperbike.com/">MCE British Superbike Championship</a>. Taking place between April and October, riders of a professional standard from around the world compete to become champion. This championship is considered by many to be the top national series of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>There are no set number of laps on a track day and the number that people cover depends entirely on how their track day is structured and how much time on circuit they choose to have.</p>
<p>Days are often structured in two ways – either as sessions, or an open pit lane. Track days run in sessions will usually stretch across a full day, splitting riders by ability and offering slots of around 20 minutes to one group at a time.</p>
<p>This removes the danger of complete novices being intimidated by much faster, experienced track riders and reducing accident risk. These sessions are also sometimes just run in the evening at some tracks.</p>
<p>An open pit lane event is often reserved for riders of an intermediate skill level and up and are popular with faster riders and racers. On these days, there are no sessions and the track is open all day for everyone (hence the name).</p>

<h2>Key Words...</h2>
<p>Below is a basic jargon-busting list of key terms used by riders at a race track. Some also translate into road riding and are well-known in the biking fraternity. <span class="span">Click on the images below to reveal the definitions.</span></p>
<div id="card1">
  <div class="front">
  Knee down image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Knee down: </span>The ultimate pub bragging right for most riders, a knee down is the process of a rider's knee slider making connection with the ground during a turn.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card2">
  <div class="front">
    Knee slider image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Knee slider: </span>A knee slider is a puck that sits on a rider’s knee outside their leathers. These are designed to scrape along the tarmac as it makes contact with the ground during a corner.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card3">
  <div class="front">
    Elbow down image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Elbow down: </span>With advancements in motorcycle design comes changes to riding styles. The elbow down takes leaning off a bike to new heights and sees a rider reach a big enough lean angle for their elbow to strike the ground.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card4">
  <div class="front">
    Low side image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Low side: </span>A low side is a type of crash which sees the bike slide away from the rider after breaking traction, causing a crash.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card5">
  <div class="front">
    High side image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">High side: </span>Often considered a more painful crash, a high side occurs when a bike loses traction and begins to slide, however then regains traction. This often causes riders to be violently ejected from their machines, before crashing down onto the tarmac. Ouch.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card6">
  <div class="front">
    Apex image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Apex: </span>The apex of a corner is the point on the inside of a turn that a rider will pass closest to. Hitting the apex means riders are reducing the radius of the corner to its lowest, meaning they can carry more speed through the turn. Hitting these points can also be described as the racing line.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card7">
  <div class="front">
    Chicane image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Chicane: </span>This is a sharp double bend on a track, either serving as an obstacle or barrier to users. The corners slow speeds down quite significantly.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card8">
  <div class="front">
    Supersport image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Supersport: </span>Predominantly a 600cc machine, such as Yamaha’s R6 and Kawasaki’s ZX-6R, these bikes are characteristically high revving with great handling. They are fantastic track day machines; however, some riders favour bigger engines with more power.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card9">
  <div class="front">
    Superbike image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Superbike: </span>These are bigger bikes, which mainly use 1000cc engines (although some have a larger displacement). They offer more power and top end speed than the supersport bikes, however this much grunt can sometimes be unfavourable at more technical tracks.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card10">
  <div class="front">
    Chatter image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Chatter: </span>This is a vibration that comes from the bike during a corner. It can cause the rider discomfort and unsettle the bike. It is caused by the bike’s suspension being unable to cope with the forces acted upon them.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card11">
  <div class="front">
    Arm pump image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Arm pump: </span>This is an issue that affects some riders. Track riding can be quite physically intense and this can cause some people intermittent pain in their forearms. This can affect performance and one’s ability to steer the bike. Racers have operations to deal with the problem.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card12">
  <div class="front">
    Chicken strip image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Chicken strip: </span>No, not the Kentucky variety. Chicken strips refer to the degree of lean riders are getting on their bikes. This is because the further you lean a bike over, the more of the tyre gets used. Riders not using the full extent of their tyres will see a band of unused rubber form at the sides of their tyres – known as chicken strips.
  </div>
</div>
<div id="card13">
  <div class="front">
    Wheelie image
  </div>
  <div class="back">
    <span class="span">Wheelie: </span>A term used to describe the front wheel of the motorcycle lifting off the ground under acceleration. Though some riders like to show off by holding a wheelie for extended periods, any deliberate stunting like this is banned on most track days.

<header><h1>The cost of fun</h1></header>
</section>
<section class="content">
<h2>How much for a good set-up?</h2>
<p>A good track day set up is entirely subjective and depends on your budget and motorcycle preference. Some people may prefer something with a smaller engine and predictable handling, whereas others may prefer power and outright top speed for faster circuits.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a reasonable set up for a track day. It is by no means definitive, but goes some way towards demostrating the costs involved.</p>
<p>I have chosen to use a 2005 Suzuki GSX-R 750 for this. Now 12-years-old, this is still a very capable bike and popular with track day riders. This is because its 749cc engine is deemed by many to be the perfect blend of speed and power both on and off track.</p>
<h3>Suzuki GSX-R 750 K5</h3>
<p><span class="span">Price (used):</span> £4000</p>
<p><span class="span">Power:</span> 146bhp</p>
<p><span class="span">Torque:</span> 64ft-lb</p>
<p><span class="span">Top Speed:</span> 175mph</p>
<p><span class="span">Engine:</span> 749cc in-line four</p>
<p>Many riders like to add aditional modifications to their bikes to improve performance and make them a little more personal. Below are some of the more popular additions:</p>
<p><span class="span">Performance exhaust:</span> £250-£630 (Yoshimura end cans)</p>
<p><span class="span">Sticky tyres:</span> £159.26 (Metzeler Racetec RR - depending on your wheel size)</p>
<p><span class="span">Better brake pads:</span> £40-£50 (SBS fully sintered)</p>
<p><span class="span">Better brake lines:</span> £59.99 (Hel Performance braided brake hoses)</p>
<p><span class="span">Lightweight wheels:</span> £2500-£3500 (BST lightweight wheels)</p>

<h2>About Nick</h2>
<p><span class="span">Position:</span> Director</p>
<p><span class="span">Riding experience:</span> 18 years</p>
<p><span class="span">Current bike:</span> Honda VTR1000 SP2</p>
<p><span class="span">Preferred bike type:</span> 1000cc V-twin sportsbikes</p>
</div>
<p>Taking a motorcycle on a race track is a risky business. Riding at speed and testing your ability to its limits means most insurance companies will not cover your bike on a circuit. It is simply too much of a risk for them.</p>
<p>As such, most riders are risking the full value of their machine every time they leave the pit lane for another session. They aren’t covered like they are on the road, meaning they will have to pick up the pieces (quite literally) if they crash.</p>
<p>However, insurance firm <a href="https://www.bemoto.uk/?gclid=CPDo696B5dICFW0A0wodr8QKew">bemoto</a> is looking to break this mould – offering riders track day cover and alleviating one less stress in your mind before the day.</p>
<p>Nick Fenton is one of three Directors at bemoto and was a keen track day rider until his daughter was born six years ago – doing 10 to 15 events every year. He believes track days are the safest place to experience the full capabilities of your motorcycle.</p>
<p>"On the track, unless it’s the Nürburgring that is, you’ve got run off. If you do come off, yes, you’re going to go into the gravel trap and believe me I’ve done it many a time." Nick said.</p>
<p>"It’s not the nicest of experiences but it’s much better than coming off on an A road, where you come off, hit a tree and that’s it – it’s game over."</p>
<p>The firm in its first year of trading, after being established just 18-months-ago. Cover is available for machines worth more than £2000 and will protect riders on even the most extreme of tracks, such as the infamous <a href="http://www.nuerburgring.de/en/home.html">Nürburgring</a>, which snakes through around 12 miles of German forest with over 80 corners.</p>
<p>"It’s the excitement of it. These 1000cc superbikes - that we all love and ride – first gear and you’re already over the speed limit and you’ve got another five gears! I think a lot of people do it to get to know their bike." Nick added.</p>
<p>"It’s in a nice, safe, legal environment. I think that’s why a lot of people do go on track days. If you get caught speeding on the road now you become public enemy number one."</p>
<blockquote>'If you get caught speeding on the road now you become public enemy number one.'<br> ~ <em>Nick Fenton</em></blockquote>
<p>As well as track cover, bemoto will also insure motorcycles that haven’t been road registered. People buy these bikes specifically to ride on circuits and have no interest in making them road-legal.</p>
<p>Nick said: "We recognise there is a heck of a lot of people with bikes that aren’t registered. Personally, myself, about six years ago I had a Yamaha R1 track bike stolen from my garage and I had to pick up the pieces because it wasn’t insured. Believe me, if you get one of those bikes stolen and it’s not insured it’s not a nice place to be."</p>
<p>Another consideration for riders is the risk of injury you expose yourself to. Broken bones are not uncommon and deaths have been recorded. To combat this risk, bemoto also offer cover against injury and a subsequent loss of earnings caused by accidents.</p>
<p>"It’s a very exciting hobby, but it costs a lot of money. A lot of guys doing track days are probably quite successful. Because these guys are quite affluent, they probably run their own businesses.</p>
<p>"If you’re on a track and really, seriously injure yourself then that injury could mean you can’t work for months and you’re going to lose a lot of business. We can now insure you for this injury."</p>
<p>This cover is not only offered to enthusiasts on track days, but also professional racers in the British Superbike Championship, who can use similar policies to cover them against season-ending crashes while racing.</p>

<h2>Sharing the passion: Trackday Addicts</h2>
<p>Trackday Addicts is a website and social media outlet for track day enthusiast to share their passion for motorcycles, as well as buy and sell related items – including bikes, vans and riding gear.</p>
<p>The group was established around four and a half years ago by Ryan Clare, 36, who set up the Facebook page for he and his friends to discuss all things two-wheeled after he grew tired of signing up to internet forums.</p>
<figure class="ryan"><img src="images/ryanclare1.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Left knee down through Mansfield corner at Cadwell Park. Photo by Alex James Photography.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Facebook page alone has since grown to just shy of 15,000 members – attracting users internationally, as well as some well-known racers – including multiple British Champion Mike ‘Spike’ Edwards.</p>
<p>A website containing articles, blog posts, images and merchandise has also since been created.</p>
<span class="span"><p>I spoke to Ryan about why he established the group, his love affair with European track days and his passion for motorcycles.</p></span>
<p>"In a couple of years, it’s gone ridiculous and grown by a thousand people every few months and it’s just under 15,000 people now. In the last two years, I think half of that has come."</p>
<p>Ryan started his track day journey six years ago on a Yamaha R6 supersport motorcycle, after a colleague at work said he should ride on circuit. He has since gone on to take part in club racing and was a track instructor for two years.</p>
<p>"I used to commute and get out for a bit of a Sunday blast, but one of the guys I worked with said I should do a track day. I did one at Silverstone and within a few laps I said this is where I belong."</p>
<p>As well as UK events, Ryan is fortunate enough to ride at some European circuits. He explained the differences between the two events: "A lot of European events do use transponders – so you end up in the right group.</p>
<p>"In the UK no one uses transponders, so you end up being in mixed groups. Depending on what day you do in the UK it can feel a bit busy.</p>
<blockquote>'I think that’s why other people don’t understand it. In all the other sports I’ve played, the atmosphere’s not like that.'<br> ~ <em>Ryan Clare</em></blockquote>
<p>"Euro days tend to be that little bit faster because people are a little bit more experienced. The tracks in Europe tend to be Grand Prix ones, so they tend to be fast flowing and have a lot more history." Ryan said.</p>
<p>"I prefer the Euro days because you can actually build up – it’s like a race meet. First day, you get to blow out the cobwebs and I think a lot of people come home after the three days with a grin on their face."</p>
<p>Though Ryan claims to prefer European events to those hosted in the UK, he recognises and praises the comradery between riders both in the UK and abroad.</p>
<figure class="ryan2"><img src="images/ryanclare2.jpg" alt="" /><figcaption>Ryan's Kawasaki ZX-10R at Circuito de Jerez, Spain, in March this year.</figcaption></figure>
<p>"It’s a way of life, really. I’m potentially moving to New York and the first thing I’m looking for is ‘where’s the local track?’ You meet great people and people are genuinely willing to help you out.</p>
<p>"I think that’s why other people don’t understand it. In all the other sports I’ve played, the atmosphere’s not like that.</p>
<p>"I just think it’s a chance to get on your bike. You don’t have to worry about cars and you don’t have to about traffic. It’s about you and testing your ability and how fast you can go – not necessarily in the straights."</p>

<p>The figures above show a continued trend of decreasing road deaths for car and motorcycle users between 2000 and 2013. Numbers remain higher for cars at every stage, due to their higher presence on the roads.</p>
<p>Despite this, the graph below represents an increase in incidents on the roads between 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>Comparing data between July and September over both years shows drivers killed or seriously injured increased by seven per cent, whilst accidents amongst bikers rose by 14 per cent. Figures amongst walkers increased by one per cent and cyclists 10 per cent. The graph displays the 2016 figures.</p>

<h2>Safety concerns</h2>
<p>One of the reasons why riders take to the track is because of the dangers of riding a motorcycle on the road. Whilst it is seriously good fun and a fantastic way to spend your free time either alone or with friends, research conducted by the Department for Transport found that bikers are roughly <span class="span">38</span> times more likely to be killed in a road traffic accident than a car driver, per mile travelled.</p>
<p>In 2013, this equated to <span class="span">331</span> rider deaths and <span class="span">4866</span> people seriously injured in road collisions in Great Britain.</p>
<p>This figure has fallen since 2008 though, when <span class="span">493</span> motorcyclists were killed and <span class="span">5556</span> were seriously injured.</p>
<p>Their research also found that <span class="span">30</span> motorcyclists are killed or injured every day at junctions.</p>
<h2>Getting the most from your machine</h2>
<p>Some riders leave the roads behind because you cannot exploit the full potential of many motorcycles on the road, legally.</p>
<p>Modern 'litre' 1000cc sports motorcycles, such as Honda's <a href="http://www.honda.co.uk/motorcycles/range/super-sport/cbr1000rr-fireblade/overview.html">CBR1000RR Fireblade</a> or Kawasaki's <a href="http://www.kawasaki.co.uk/en/products/supersport/2017/ninja_zx-10r_/overview?Uid=083CX15dXF8OXV1bX18MXFoJXAoKXg1aWVFZXgwOWAxfUFg">ZX-10R Ninja</a> can eclipse speeds of <span class="span">100mph</span> in first gear alone and will continue to a limited top speed just shy of <span class="span">190mph</span>.</p>
<p>The video to the left shows some of the consequences of fast road riding. The rider on film, 60-year-old Robert Hammond, was stopped by Sussex Police wearing a helmet camera. Police seized this and discovered over 150 clips of him riding.</p>
<p>These clips included recordings of Hammond travelling at <span class="span">153mph</span> and pulling wheelies on his 1000cc Honda Fireblade. He was sentenced to two years in prison for his actions and was disqualified from driving for two years after he finishes his sentence. He will also have to take an extended re-test to get it back.</p>
